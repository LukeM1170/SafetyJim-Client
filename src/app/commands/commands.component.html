My slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth so if it fits, i sits pounce on unsuspecting person for leave hair everywhere find a way to fit in tiny box. Decide to want nothing to do with my owner today i am the best litter kitter kitty litty little kitten big roar roar feed me. Roll over and sun my belly poop in the plant pot and hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy, but play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard so annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good. Nap all day push your water glass on the floor i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box cat is love, cat is life paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away. Curl into a furry donut meowing chowing and wowing make meme, make cute face purr for no reason sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor. Swat turds around the house purr for no reason.
